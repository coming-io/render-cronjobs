# Render Minimal

A repo of nothing.

This repo demonstrates a bare minimum setup to execute a command based cronjob.

Key is to do nothing for the build command, "true" accomplishes this.

Bear in mind, the binary being executed needs to be installed in the environment (which might not always be the case)

See included render.yaml for details.
